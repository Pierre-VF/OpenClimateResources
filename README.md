# Open Climate Resources - an open list of climate-related resources

This repository is aimed at sharing links to climate-related resources. Contributions are welcome, so if you see anything missing, please free free to open a pull request (with a guide [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md) if you've never done that before).

Note: this page is meant to be an open list of resources including commercial services, it does not imply that any of the target links is endorsed.
